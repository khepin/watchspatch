# Overall debounce duration
#
# For a given pattern:command combination, if a file is modified that matches the same pattern within
# "debounce" duration of the first one, it will be ignored.
# Format is `ND` where `N` is an integer and `D` is one of: `[ns, ms, s, m, h]` respectively for
# nanoseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes and hours
debounce="200ms"

# Map of `glob-pattern => command`
# Every time a file is modified that matches the given glob pattern, the command will be executed.
# Commands are executed at most once per pattern per debounce period.
# If one of the pattern / command combination would benefit from a longer / shorter debounce than the others
# it can be adjusted on a per command basis

# "**/*.go"={cmd = "echo 'a go file was modified at any depth level of subdirectories'"}
# `docker build` takes a while, so use a custom debounce value
# "Dockerfile"={cmd = "docker build", debounce="2m"}
